import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { CartContext } from '../CartContext';

const Product = ({ product }) => {
  const { cart } = useContext(CartContext);

  // Add to cart
  const addToCart = (e, product) => {
    e.preventDefault(); // to prevent redirecting to SingleProduct on clicking "ADD".

    // When clicked on "ADD", there may be a chance that some products are already added to cart. So, once clicked, first existing data in the cart must be copied:
    let _cart = { ...cart }; // {}

    // '_' in '_cart' represents that the variable is local, not coming from other components as prop. 'cart' state in App is passed as data in 'value', and it received here with useContext. Then, 'cart' is copied using spread operator as {...cart} to prevent manipulation of main 'cart' object as objects are always passed as reference. This 'cart' object is stored in local variable '_cart'. So, for '_cart' the value will be what is stored in useState in App which is an empty object in the beginning ({}). As its value updates, the value of '_cart' will be updated.

    // Logic for cart data:
    // cart will be an object, which has 'items' object in it that contains 'id' of items as key and number of that item as its value. And it contains 'totalItems' that has the value of total number of items in the cart as shown below (for understanding purpose):
    /* 
    const cart = {
      items: {
        '60c67bdff5ee510015f3dda8': 2,
        '60c67bc0f5ee510015f3dda7': 3,
      },
      totalItems: 5,
    }; 
    */
